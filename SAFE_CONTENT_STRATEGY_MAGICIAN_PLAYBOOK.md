✅ **SAFE #2 - Thought Leadership:**
```
🤖 The Future of SaaS is AI-Powered, Not AI-Replaced

As someone who builds AI-integrated SaaS platforms, 
here's my take on where we're heading:

1. AI Augmentation > AI Replacement
   → Users still want control
   → AI assists, doesn't decide

2. Edge Computing + AI = Perfect Match
   → Low latency AI at the edge
   → Privacy-first architecture

3. Prompt Engineering = New Developer Skill
   → Understanding LLMs matters
   → Integration > Implementation

4. Rapid MVPs Will Dominate
   → Market rewards speed
   → Perfect code is overrated

5. Solo Founders Can Compete
   → AI levels the playing field
   → Small teams, big impact

The developer who adapts fastest wins.
